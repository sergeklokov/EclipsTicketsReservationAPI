This is simple API demo application.

We have eclipse events, with location and time. 
We need to subscribe users to these events, and sell them tickets ahead of time..

Thinking: each user related to a bunch of eclipse events which make many-to-many relationship.
This will cause us to create a join table, which will be used to store the user and event relationship.
